When running 'jupyter lab', it complained that it needed nodejs, that notebook recipe_sender rev2.
ipynb isn't trusted and didn't actually run any of the Python cells.
So, install nodejs:

pip install nodejs

... and re-started JupyterLab:

jupyter lab

At first, it still didn't execute anything. Re-stsarted the kernel and all is good.
